# Escornabot COVID19 - 3D models

Updated models of the **Escornabot Brivoi-DIY** version to the last version of [FreeCAD](https://freecadweb.org) (v0.19), using exclusively the **Part-Design workbench** and including some minor changes to suit my own personal needs and issues (that may be useful for others too).
