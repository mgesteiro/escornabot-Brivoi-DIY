For **iOS systems** you can use the [Escornabot BLE App](https://apps.apple.com/es/app/escornabot-ble/id1444892609), that is also open-source and available on [Ismael Serrano's github](https://github.com/ismaserrano/EscornaBotMobile).

Finally, if you like to tinker yourself, you can use **any BLE App, Escanner or tool** that allows you to connect and send characters to the dongle: you should send any of the `[n, w, g, e, s, N, W, G, E, S]` characters followed by a line feed (`LF` or `\n`) as commands (**n**orth, **s**outh, **e**ast, **w**est and **g**o).
