# Escornabot COVID19
My own update to some parts of the [Escornabot project](https://github.com/escornabot) during the COVID-19 lockdown.

* **3D:** Inspired in the genius work and lessons from [Xoan](https://github.com/xoan?tab=repositories&q=escornabot), updated the **Escornabot-DIY** models to the last version of [FreeCAD](https://freecadweb.org) (v0.19), using exclusively the **Part-Design workbench** and including some minor changes to suit my own personal needs and issues (that may be useful for others too).

* **fritzing:** Connections schematic done with [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org).
